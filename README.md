## Description

This was a quick project that I did to help learn Vue. 
The goals were to make an app that could be used to show a random song from a list. 

Being ARMY, it needed to be a BTS song with an embedded video to watch. 

However, I really wanted the components to be reuseable so I could feature songs from other groups too, AND I wanted to learn how to make reuseable components where I could inject data from a parent component, similar to using props in React, and what do you know... There are props in Vue! Woot!
